# Proposal for Free Software Educational Project - ClassNotesForYou

## Introduction

We introduce "ClassNotesForYou" - a revolutionary free software project focused on liberating educational resources. "ClassNotesForYou" is grounded in the belief that knowledge should be freely accessible to all, providing educational materials without restrictions. This project seeks to uphold the ideals of free software, offering an open platform for collaboration and learning.

## Project Goals

1. **Free as in Freedom**: Embrace the principles of the Free Software Foundation, ensuring that users have the liberty to use, study, modify, and share the software and educational content.

2. **Universal Accessibility**: Provide a platform where anyone, regardless of their background, can access and contribute to a wealth of educational resources.

3. **Nonprofit Usage**: Guarantee that the materials generated are exclusively for nonprofit educational purposes, aligning with the ethos of free education.

4. **GPL Licenses**: Adhere to the General Public License (GPL) to safeguard the freedom of the software and ensure that it remains open and accessible.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup

- **GitHub Repository**: Establish a dedicated GitHub repository as the nucleus of the project. This repository will serve as the cornerstone for hosting the code and educational content.

- **GitHub Page**: Develop a user-friendly GitHub Page that not only showcases the project but also provides a seamless interface for users to explore, contribute, and learn.

### Phase 2: Content Generation and Enhancement

- **Python Code**: Implement the Python code for generating educational notes, leveraging the capabilities of large language models. Additionally, facilitate manual enhancement and correction of generated content to ensure accuracy and completeness.

- **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation outlining how contributors can create notes, what content they should include, and the process for submitting Pull Requests (PRs). Emphasize the importance of free software principles.

- **Multimedia Support**: Encourage contributors to enrich the notes with supplementary content like videos, images, PowerPoint presentations, etc., emphasizing the freedom to share knowledge in various formats.

- **Metadata Management**: Utilize JSON structures to store additional details for each note, including branch, semester, subject, module, topic, note type, and relevant links.

### Phase 3: Automation and Organization

- **File Creation**: Automate the process of creating HTML files for notes, ensuring standardized naming conventions and proper organization. Notes will be stored in separate folders structured by branch, semester, and module.

    - Example Path: `content/notes/cse/sem_1/mod_1/topic_name.html`

- **Database**: Implement a separate CSV file to store metadata for each note. The database will facilitate efficient topic-wise search.

    - Fields: branch, sem, subject, topic, file_path

### Phase 4: Community Engagement

- **Guidelines**: Develop clear guidelines for contributors, emphasizing the significance of free software principles, accuracy, and quality in their submissions.

- **Collaboration**: Encourage educators, students, and professionals to collaborate on the project, fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility.

- **Review Process**: Implement a robust review process to ensure that submitted notes adhere to quality standards before being included in the repository.

- **Feedback Mechanism**: Establish an efficient feedback mechanism to address issues, answer questions, and provide support to contributors.

## Quotations by Richard Stallman

1. "Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in freedom.

2. "Sharing is good, and with digital technology, sharing is easy."

3. "The only way to have software you can trust is to have software that is free and open source."

## Licensing

"ClassNotesForYou" will be released under the GPL (GNU General Public License), adhering to the principles set forth by the Free Software Foundation.

## Conclusion

"ClassNotesForYou" embodies the spirit of Richard Stallman's Free Software Foundation, championing the cause of free education for all. By creating an organized repository of educational materials and providing a platform for collaboration, we aim to empower learners worldwide. We invite educators, students, and enthusiasts to join us in this noble endeavor, where the only currency is knowledge, and the beneficiaries are countless.

Let's bridge the knowledge gap together, one note at a time.

# Contributor's Guide: Creating Notes for ClassNotesForYou

## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to ClassNotesForYou, a free and open-source educational project aimed at making quality study materials accessible to all. Your contribution plays a crucial role in empowering students and learners worldwide. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of creating notes for ClassNotesForYou.

## Phase 1: Selecting Engineering Branches

In the first phase of our project, we are focusing on creating educational content for the following major engineering branches:

1. Computer Science and Engineering
2. Civil Engineering
3. Electrical and Electronics Engineering
4. Electronics and Communications Engineering
5. Mechanical Engineering

## Phase 2: Organizing the Content

### Subject - Module - Topic Hierarchy

Our educational materials are organized in a structured manner:

- **Subject**: Each subject represents a distinct area of study within an engineering branch.
- **Module**: Subjects are further divided into modules, which group related topics together.
- **Topic**: Modules consist of individual topics that cover specific aspects of the subject.

## Phase 3: Creating Notes

### Method 1: Manual Note Creation

You can create notes manually by following these steps:

1. Select a Subject: Choose the engineering branch and subject for which you want to create notes.

2. Choose a Module: Within the selected subject, pick a module that interests you.

3. Select a Topic: Inside the chosen module, select a specific topic that you wish to create notes for.

4. Note Structure: Create your notes in Markdown format. Include clear explanations, diagrams, examples, and any additional resources that will aid learners.

5. Note File: Save your notes as an individual Markdown (`.md`) file with a clear and descriptive file name, such as `topic_name.md`.

6. Update Master CSV: After creating your notes, update the details in the master CSV file. This file helps us maintain an organized repository.

### Method 2: Automated Note Generation

Alternatively, you can automate the note generation process using the Python script provided in the project. This script utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate notes based on provided prompts. Here's how it works:

1. Run the Python Script: Execute the Python script, providing prompts and instructions as needed.

2. Note Review: After the script generates notes, review and enhance them as necessary to ensure accuracy and completeness.

3. Save Generated Notes: Save the generated notes as individual Markdown (`.md`) files with descriptive file names.

4. Update Master CSV: Update the details of the newly generated notes in the master CSV file.

## Contribution Guidelines

Before contributing, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- **Quality**: Strive for accuracy, clarity, and completeness in your notes. Aim to create materials that are helpful for students.
